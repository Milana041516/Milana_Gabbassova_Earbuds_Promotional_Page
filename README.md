# Earbuds Promotional Page

This assignment aims to encourage students to explore and research innovative concepts for a new pair of earbuds and their charging case. Students will then use Cinema 4D to model, texture, light, and animate their designs. These assets will be utilized as resources on a promotional website.

The project also includes the creation of various assets, such as:

* Multiple color variations of the earbuds
* An X-ray view showcasing the internal components
* Promotional images or animations

Additionally, the 3D model will be exported for use as an augmented reality (AR) object on the promotional site, featuring interactive informational hot spots or an animated exploded view.
